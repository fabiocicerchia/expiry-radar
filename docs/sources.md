# Sources and permissions

## Sources (all read-only)

| Source | What it reads | Credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tls:endpoint` | leaf certificates from a live handshake | none |
| `tls:chain` | every intermediate CA presented, deduplicated across hosts | none |
| `domain:rdap` | registrar expiry over RDAP (the protocol that replaced WHOIS) | none |
| `k8s` | TLS secrets, with ingress class/hosts for context | service account, two `list` verbs |
| `vault` | the token's own TTL, and certificates in PKI mounts | `VAULT_TOKEN`, read + list |
| `aws` | ACM certificates, IAM access key age, Secrets Manager rotation | standard credential chain |

The endpoint prober deliberately skips certificate verification: an
already-expired certificate is exactly what this tool exists to find, and
verification would reject the handshake before the date could be read. Nothing
is sent over the connection and no trust decision is made from it.

IAM access keys have no expiry — AWS will happily serve a five-year-old key —
so `maxKeyAgeDays` (default 90) turns key age into the rotation deadline the
rest of the tool can rank. That is the secret-rotation calendar, merged in.

The Kubernetes source talks to the API server with `net/http` rather than
pulling in client-go: two GETs against two stable endpoints do not justify that
dependency tree. For laptop use, run `kubectl proxy` and point `k8s.server` at
`http://127.0.0.1:8001`.

## Non-negotiable: read-only

expiry-radar never needs write access, and the shipped credentials say so:

- `docs/iam-readonly-policy.json` — five List/Describe actions, nothing else.
- `docs/rbac-readonly.yaml` — `list` on ingresses and secrets, namespace-scoped
  by default (note: `list` on secrets returns private keys, so scope it).
- `docs/vault-readonly-policy.hcl` — read + list only.

Deliberately **not** implemented: enumerating Vault dynamic leases. That endpoint
is a PUT needing `update` plus `sudo`, which would break the read-only promise
this tool is sold on. PKI mounts answer the same question with reads.
